review/summary: Wonderful Treat!
review/text: These treats are great!  They smell wonderful and my dogs love them!  They are also very healthy and great for my dog who is a little over weight as they are low calorie.  The seller was excellent and the treats got here much faster than what was originally estimated.  I would definitely recommend them for anyone with small dogs.  The only downfall is that they are a little pricey but well worth it.

review/text: These are great dog treats.  I definately recommend them to anyone searching for a healthy treat for their pet.  Both of my boxers love them and get excited when I open a bag.  They are only 1 calorie per treat and they come in a fun shape and decent size.  I don't feel the need to break them in half unless I'm training or I'm running low while we're on a walk.  I've bought the variety pack 3 times now.

review/text: Our dogs absolutely love these treats.  I bought them for my Schnauzer and my friend's Poodle, and both Casey and Bella LOVE them....and in every flavor!  It appears that the blueberry may be their favorite flavor, but they both are eager to snack on ALL the flavors!  And purchasing them in the 4-pack saves not only on the cost of the treats but on shipping as well!  It ended up averaging just at or under $5 per 7 oz. bag!  For this quality, and for how much our dogs love them, that's a fantastic price!!!

Makes a great cookies and cream ice cream too or mint chocolate chip. They're in patty form, just like the York Peppermint Patty candy, but not quite as thick.

review/summary: Great Alternative Sweetener
review/text: My review covers the Stevia In The Raw product in packet form. I have not tried the bulk product.<br /><br />This is a great alternative sweetener. It leaves no after taste that I can detect. I use it in tea, on cereal and in three different kinds of oatmeal. Everything that I have used it in or on has tasted the same as it did when sugar was used.<br /><br />I cam accross a couple of articles on Stevia while browsing on the Internet. After reading those two articles I did a little more research and decided to try Stevia. I found this product at our local Kroger store where it happened to be on sale. Kroger carries two ro three other Stevia based products however after comparing the list of ingredients for each I decided to buy the Stevia In The Raw. The list of ingredients for the packet form of this product is dextrose and Stevia Extract (Rebiana).<br /><br />OK, I tired it and it tastes great in everyhting I have used it with but I was curious. The Stevia extract is supposed to be 200 to 400 times more intensely sweet than sugar. If that is the case why was dextrose used and why was it the more prevalent ingredient? I called the company on their 800 and asked this same question. The answer is (according to them) that dextrose is a carbohydrate derived from crushed corn. It is a filler in their product. The Rebiana is so intensely sweet that it was impractical to package it in its pure form in individual packets. The volume would be so small that consumers would wonder if anything was really there. To me this sounds plausible. I am not a dietician, a doctor nor do I work for the company. I simply use their product and like it.<br /><br />I hope this info is helpful. Everyone have a gret day out there.

review/summary: You'll need 3 packs to equal one pack of Truvia. Not a bargain.
review/text: First of all, I have no ties with Truvia. In fact, I decided to replace my Truvia recently with Stevia in the Raw which is why I'm now typing this. In my grocery store the Stevia in the Raw was cheaper. I'd always felt Truvia expensive, so I was all over that.<br /><br />While I personally do not believe the phrase "You get what you pay for" since sometimes a consumer is only paying for more marketing in a more expensive product...in this case, it's true.<br /><br />I do like sugar in the raw and I do buy it. It's way better than regular sugar being bleached and processed through bone char (for reals).<br /><br />But, first of all, this isn't "in the raw". That would mean it's pure Stevia. It also contains Dextrose. Dextrose is a very cheap additive that's sweet that's made from corn. It's high carb. Great if you just finished a tough workout and need carbs. Not great if you call yourself Stevia in the RAW<br /><br />Having formerly worked in food chemical sales, I know that Dextrose is Glucose. This is not an artificial additive, however diabetes is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. I therefore find it quite scary that this is labeled "raw" when diabetics may use it or someone wishing to avoid sugar would use it.  Now granted, Truvia has a fruit sweetener in it as well, because stevia is actually SO sweet that you'd have hardly anything in a pack otherwise because it takes very little stevia to sweeten something, but it's not calling itself "raw" either.<br /><br />But let's bypass that and take our sugar/stevia packs and move on. Is the rest the same?<br /><br />Huh-uh.<br /><br />You get 50 packs of Stevia in the Raw in a box.<br />You get 40 packs of Truvia in a box.<br /><br />Superb huh?<br /><br />Likely, because Stevia in the Raw was a tiny bit less expensive, you will do as I did and think "Woo Hoo! I get more for less!" Aw, those marketing dogs saw me coming a mile away.<br /><br />Not so fast.<br /><br />I kept making my coffee and hating the taste of it. Bitter.  I began adding 2 packs of Stevia in the Raw. Still not sweet. I had just bought a new coffee and I was thinking it must be stronger of something. Then I found a pack of Truvia I had in the drawer and realized how much MORE was in the pack simply by picking up the pack. I added that one pack to my coffee and it tasted, finally, sweet again.<br /><br />So that got me thinking...<br /><br />I go to the Stevia in the Raw box and look at the net weight of those 50 packets.<br />It is 1.75 ounces.<br />I then, when shopping again, pick up a box of Truvia (and buy it of course because I'm tired of coffee tasting unsweetened.) and for 40 packets it's 4.9 ounces!!!!<br /><br />WOA! I've just been had. I have to use about 3-4 of those Stevia in the Raw packets to equal the taste of one Truvia packet because there is next to nothing inside the packet..just as I suspected. They gave me more packets with less inside each one. So I have to waste paper, and time opening packet after packet just for one cup o' joe.<br /><br />And quite frankly, I don't like deceptive marketing and it's going on all over every 1.75 ounce box of Stevia in the Raw.<br /><br />But, wait...one more thing...<br /><br />Because Stevia in the Raw has sugar in it in glucose form, is it really 0 calories for the same amount? or just a low amount in one packet but by the time you use 4, how many calories may have snuck in....because 0.5 calories can add up too.  Not that I care about 4 calories or 2 calories, but in comparing the two products, and how little is in a packet of Stevia in the Raw...<br /><br />It wouldn't surprise me.<br /><br />Truvia, by the way, has Erythritol in it. This is one of the best all-natural zero calorie sweeteners you can buy. The Brand Z Sweet is erythritol. It's great for diabetics and dieters because it's the one that will NOT spike your blood sugar but is still all-natural. Stevia is so lightweight it needs a counterpart. Erythritol is a stevia cousin. Dextrose is a cheap filler that isn't.

review/summary: This is the only brand out there with minimal aftertaste
review/text: I'm not 100% certain this is the same product sold at [...], but this is the only place I could find to review it, and I wanted to review it somewhere.  I love this stuff.  I've tried all the major stevia brands (including everything at Whole Foods), and Stevia in the Raw (which Whole Foods doesn't carry, sadly) is the only brand that doesn't taste like crap.  All other brands have a heavy bitter-licorice aftertaste.  Stevia in the Raw is unique in that I can put the powder itself to my tongue without grimacing.  I can't even do that with "normal" (i.e. toxic) sweeteners like NutraSweet or Equal (though Splenda tastes fine raw.)  I suppose I have a somewhat sensitive palate, and with the heavy amounts of sweetener I use, I can still detect a slight aftertaste even with Stevia in the Raw -- so if you're a heavy user with a sensitive palate, then just combine it with some erythritol and you're good to go.  No aftertaste whatsoever with that combo.  And this is way better for you than any other (palatable) sweetener.

review/summary: The best Stevia sweetener! NO FUNKY AFTERTASTE!!!
review/text: I've tried for years and years to like stevia, but it's always left a funky aftertaste in my mouth that just ruined it's use for me. Until now, the most tolerable of the stevias was the vanilla cream by sweetleaf, but even that left the funky after taste.<br /><br />A few months ago I decided to go on a marathon stevia taste test adventure and bought almost every brand out there to give them each a go. I didn't have high expectations as I fully expected them all to leave me with the funky taste. I did not do truvia, because it has another added sweetener - it is not pure stevia. I only tested those that were pure stevia plain flavor and vanilla flavor (since the sweetleaf vanilla had been the best one so far).<br /><br />I was shocked beyond belief when using the stevia in the raw and not having any funky after taste! I tried it many different ways - in chai tea, to sweeten hot breakfast cereal, for baking and cooking sweet treats, etc. and no aftertaste! I also tried larger quantities, as sometimes the more you use the increased after taste. So far no matter what I've done with this stevia I've had NO aftertaste what-so-ever!!!<br /><br />If you've tried to like stevia and just can't get past the after taste then give stevia in the raw a go - I think you'll be very surprised and pleased as I've been. Yay - finally a stevia I like.

review/summary: Very good stevia without any extra ingredients.
review/text: I bought them at Shoprite (at 3.79 for a box of 50, its cheaper than from this seller) and I am so happy that I can enjoy sweet things again!  I compared it to other sweetners such as truvia and purvia, I like this product because I won't support coca cola(maker of truvia) or pepsi (maker of purvia) if i buy this.  Also, there is only two ingredients : dextrose and stevia extract.  Each pack is 1 gram, so I assume there is maybe 0.9 gram of which is dextrose, which IS a sugar, but the FDA allows the labeling to be such that if a serving is under 4 calories, it can be called 'zero-calories'.<br /><br />To my understanding, dextrose is needed as the bulking agent (probably stevia extract is so potent, no one can use it if its in pure form) Online searching have shown dextrose contains 3.7 cal per gram, so if you have to use many packets for your tea or coffee, it won't be calories-free.  BUT, 3 packets of this (maybe like 10 cal) made my 12 oz of water with lemon juice taste like a real cup of lemonade made with real sugar, and THAT would be like 110 calories. And it taste so much better and healthier than splenda.

For one reviewer to call anyone who claims they like Stevia in the raw a liar, that is absurd.  Some people are so mean.  Many people drink Diet Coke and I can't stand it, even after trying to like it for years.  We all have different taste buds, obviously.  That is not a lie!

review/text: Stevia in the raw is not good for diabetics.  I was so disappointed when I read the first ingredient is dextrose.  I should have looked at the label.  I thought it was pure stevia.  Dextrose is high glycemic and can raise your blood sugar. The makers of Stevia in the Raw are deceiving people who aren't firmiliar with dextrose.  Body builders use a shake with dextrose in it.  It is not a product that a diabetic should be using.  I will be taking my box of Stevia in the<br />Raw back.

Maltodextrine is TWICE as bad for you as simple sugar.  So by cutting stevia with maltodextrine, In The Raw has negating anything positive about this product, and made it JUST AS BAD FOR YOU, if not worse than, table sugar.  Buy SweetLeaf instead.

review/text: Purchased a single box in my grocery store, thinking Stevia products would all taste the same. Big mistake. The packet aftertaste was so unpleasant that I tossed the whole box after several tries at sweetening my iced tea. Stevia in the Raw didn't even come close to the Now product I purchased formerly in packets (Stevia Extract, Non-Bitter)which contained maltodextrin (rice sugar product)that probably made the difference. Would prefer to skip maltodextrin. Perhaps the organic extract powder in containers will taste better than the packets. A disappointed consumer.

review/text: Holding the package now, the ingredients read: "Dextrose, Stevia Extract". In other words, it's primary ingredient is Dextrose with some Stevia added so they can call it that. Now, Dextrose itself is not all that bad, however, if you have a health issue and wish to use Stevia, you must read labels. Search for pure Stevia. There are much cheaper Dextrose based sweeteners here at Amazon.com  Google "Dextrose side effects" because the Stevia portion of this is harmless to anyone. I'd recommend Now:  [...]

review/text: Don't buy this. I use Sugar in the Raw and thought every once in a while it might be better if I used this alternative. Personally if I put a spoonful of mud in my coffee I'm sure it couldn't taste worse than this stuff.<br /><br />Real Sugar in the Raw is somewhat granular in texture and light brown. This stuff is white and powdery, like confectioners sugar. The taste? The worst.<br /><br />I threw the entire package away and will never buy anything like it again. I'd rather drink my coffee black. I'd never use it in any recipe, as I'm sure the taste will be 'off' and all your ingredients will be ruined.<br /><br />Find something else or do without sugar.

review/summary: This is Not PURE Stevia but 90% FILLER added
review/text: First off, just READ the Ingreients if you don't believe me!<br /> This "Stevia" in the RAW is NOT pure Stevia! It's really 90%....yes 90% FILLER! PURE STEVIA you'd use 1 TEASPOON for 1 CUP of Sugar, this crap they added so much Maltdextrin to make it equal to a cup of sugar.<br />Buy NOW FOODS "Better Stevia" if you want Stevia and save money. It will use 1 TEASPOON for what normally would take you a CUP of Sugar.<br /><br />This is outrageous! To call this "Stevia in the RAW" and then add 90% FILLER and I mean 90% FILLER!....is a JOKE! Stevia is 400 Times more sweet than Sugar, these packets should be a third smaller, but NOOOOOOOOO, they add crap Filler to equal the volume out with sugar!  There other title this company sell is "sugar in the raw" and that is 100% Pure sugar, so why here do they not also have 100% pure Stevia?  This is a RIP -OFF! If you want to pay for FILLER-ADDED crap then go ahead! *****If you really want PURE STEVIA, then buy the NOW FOODS "Better Stevia".<br />1 TEASPOON = 1 Cup of sugar. Why pay money for 90% FILLER garbage! Thank You

review/summary: Chemical Garbage!!! AVOID!!!
review/text: I have tried this in many different recipes, all to my dismay and wasted ingredients... It always comes out the same.  It tastes like serious chemicals and is so gross it overpowers everything else.  This is SOOO NOT worth the money or time!  If you're looking for a totally all natural sweetener just buy a lb of dates in the veggies section of your store, cut them in half and take out the pits/stems, soak them in like a cup of water over night (covered well over) then blend them in your blender/food processor. It will make a thick paste that you can store in a jar/container in your fridge for a couple weeks.  I know that may sound like more trouble, but really? You'd be waiting for these things in the mail and when they arrive, I know you'd be dissapointed. Dates are chemical/sugar free, all natural and totally sweet so they DO work in many recipes and even coffee/tea.  Dates, now, after trying many, many sweeteners ( I have a serious sweet tooth) are the ONLY thing I will endorse that is remotely safe for your body and also tastes GREAT.  Peace, hope this helps...

review/summary: Tastes good, but at what cost?
review/text: Stevia in the raw contains saccharine, which is most commonly found in Sweet n' Low, which has been linked to bladder cancer..."The actual warning reads:<br />"Use of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin, which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals."<br />Note that this warning was removed in 2000 by the US Congress (not by the FDA) after heavy lobbying by the saccharin industry.<br />Further research was then done on saccharin, because the FDA wished to ban saccharin outright but the food companies fought this (successfully). The National Cancer Institute ran studies in the next 2 years and found that saccharin was indeed connected with bladder cancer. People who drank only 2 cans or more a day of diet soda had an increased risk."<br /><br />Stevia by itself is one of the 'healthiest' low cal sweeteners on the market but when mixed with things like saccharine - I mean you might as well just use sweet n' low. The only pure stevia brand I have found is SweetLeaf Stevia - it is not as delicious and most certainly has a bit of an aftertaste, but I have gotten used to it since I have a blood sugar problem and can't consume sugar. My advice is that unless you physically cannot handle sugar, a small amount of raw sugar is much better for you than all this artificial crap. Just be smart about the stevia bandwagon everyone is jumping on, because pretty much every brand out there is just some other sweetener mixed with stevia and then sold as 'healthy'.

review/text: We bought this on a whim. My daughter wanted to try it out and was pulled in by the chocolate centers. It went quickly and we bought it again.<br /><br />I like it but I wouldn't consider it to be an every morning bowl of cereal. I much prefer a more hearty cereal with a little more substance.<br /><br />Krave makes for a fun snack and can take away that chocolatey craving. It's pretty dry and the chocolate inside is really some kind of a paste.<br /><br />I'd rate it moderate for nutritional content, pretty good for flavor. Not the best cereal by any means.

review/text: I have had all three of the Fiber One Bars (oats & chocolate, oats & peanut butter, and oats & caramel).  I didn't really care for the oats & chocolate, but I like the oats & peanut butter a lot.  It tastes very good with a nice mellow peanut butter flavor.  Even my young boys (6 and 3) like it.  As good as oats & peanut butter is, though, the caramel is 10 times better.  It tastes like a candy bar. Obviously, it has a firm texture, but it's not dry by any stretch.  It makes a great breakfast or part of a breakfast that can stick with you for a few hours.  It can also serve as a very satisfying snack.  I will confess that, since my supply of these bars has been limited, I haven't had my kids try them yet.  But, now that I have been finally able to order these from Amazon, I will definitely let them try this new flavor.

review/summary: Inulin -- take it slowly!
review/text: Inulin, found in chicory root, is the key ingredient here; everything else in the bar is designed to make it possible for you to eat the inulin.  Search the web on inulin (not insulin!) -- it is being touted as a wonderful probiotic ingredient.  And there's no question that eating these bars will make the trains run on time, so to speak.<br /><br />The problem is that not everyone tolerates inulin well, and tolerance is at different doses.  Some people experience gas, cramps, frequent bowel movements with tarry stool, and other kinds of GI distress.  This is not because of the increase in fiber per se -- it is a reaction to the specific fiber here, inulin.<br /><br />The bars are very sweet but don't treat them like a snack until you know how your body reacts.  (I read with horror the account of one person who sat down with a box and polished off four or five in a sitting.) Take it very very slowly.  I can tolerate one (1) bite of a bar a day; more than that and I get in trouble, period.  At one bite a day, this case of bars is lasting me a long, long time.  On the other hand, I'm not worried about the calories in the bar at that rate either.<br /><br />If you don't finish a bar you need to keep it in a baggie or container because it will dry out and become substantially less appealing.  Taste is fine, but I wish I had gotten the chocolate so that I could get my choco fix on at the same time.

review/text: I bought a boatload of these at Costsco. They ended up being 18 cents each. How could I pass up the bargain. Anyway, these are very sweet, a little too sweet for me, but they do taste good.  They are chewy and have an oatmeal cookie kind of flavor.  I don't taste much caramel flavoring, but the taste is still good enough for me to eat one a day without fussing. They go well with milk.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I've tried all the different flavors of bars that Fiber One offers and these are definitely my favorite. The caramel flavor is light and sweet and the fiber in these bars (a whopping 9g!) makes them a very filling snack or a quick meal on the go! I typically enjoy these in the afternoon to carry me through between lunch and dinner but have eaten them for breakfast on occasion as well and they keep me satisfied until lunch. Fiber is one of the hardest things for me to get enough of (25-35g is recommended daily) and these bars definitely help! Some people have reported digestive upset when eating these but I've never had a problem with them. I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Tasty Treat
review/text: If you are looking for a tasty snack, look no further.  These caramel Fiber One bars taste like a cross between a candy bar and a granola bar.  The consistency is chewy, but not so chewy that it gets stuck in your teeth.  Since each bar provides 35% of daily recommended fiber, it's relatively healthy as well.  For those individuals that are on Weight Watchers, these bars are 2 points each... and well worth it.  I highly recommend this snack.  I also recommend the peanut butter Fiber One bars, although they are not quite as tasty, in my opinion.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z40U2">Fiber One Bars Oats And Peanut Butter, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>

We had to finish the budget that day so we all sat around, stewing in our natural aroma, wondering what had happened.  Do a Google search on Fiber One F***ts and you will be amazed.  I love to eat these but not when I have to be in public later.

review/summary: High fiber isn't necessarily a good thing!
review/text: I recently cut fiber one bars out of my diet after I noticed that I get all the fiber I need in a day just by eating whole wheat bread, fruits, vegetables and nuts. If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a "healthy" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision. (And so are my friends!)

review/summary: Fiber-None Bars  Don't Be Fooled!
review/text: Fiber one bars actually don't have real fiber.  They contain inulin (from chicory root) which is technically fiber because the body can't digest it.  Unfortunately fiber is defined by anything that can't be broken down easily.  These bars do not contain REAL fiber. (The real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and cereals) So if it says "chicory root" or "inulin" in the ingredients, you can be sure you aren't eating the fiber your body can actually use.

review/text: I absolutely LOVE the pumpkin spice latte they serve at Starbucks.  My friend told me about the Via Ready Brew Pumpkin Spice packs.  While there is no nutmeg on top this stuff still hits the spot (and I can also add my own nutmeg).  Also I don't have to drive 10 minutes just to get some, wait in line, etc... I can just heat up a small pan of milk on the stove, add the Via Ready Brew to my mug, pour, mix and enjoy!  Also it is cheaper than going to Starbucks.  Their grande size latte is about $4 whereas one packet of Via Ready Brew from Amazon comes out to $2.68 for a serving.  Also, depending on your mug size you can add more or not as much milk so the flavor is to your liking.  I'm going to stock up while I can on this :)

review/summary: Just what I was looking for!
review/text: My 5 month old is teething and putting everything in her mouth. She is simultaneously showing interest in food. I was looking for something that would satisfy all of her needs and this is it. Although this is made in China, I felt confident about buying it because it is organic. The crackers are crisp and textured so they provide teething relief. However,once they get really wet they dissolve, so there's no choking risk! This plus is also a minus because if your baby is messy and gets this everywhere, clean up before they dry because they dry like cement chips!

review/text: If you want unmarked grave dust  this may be  right for you. I don't know of anyone who eats the tough skin and bitter partitions of the pomegranate but skin, membranes and seeds are crushed up and marketed as pomegranate for ingestion. If you are looking for the edible portion of the pomegranate, be more careful than I was and order unadulterated pomegranate juice. The health benefits of the pomegranate are many and tried and true and it's one of the best tastes (flavor, texture, etc) the world has to offer. Just not this product!

review/summary: An Earl Grey Tea That Won't Disappoint
review/text: *****<br />St. Dalfour's wonderful Certified Organic Earl Grey Tea is made from hand-picked, organic Ceylon tea. The flavor is enhanced by "the all natural flavor of bergamot orange", which added interest and made my tea experience delightful. The orange flavor was subtle, not overwhelming at all. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />Earl Grey teas are one of my favorite black teas, so if you are a fan also, this tea is one not to miss.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: This is Earl Grey!???
review/text: An admitted fan of Stash Earl Grey, nevertheless I endeavor to try them all.  St. Dalfour seemed intriguing, being a French company instead of British, so I gave it a try.  This tea neither tastes nor smells anything like Earl Grey.  The aroma of the tea upon opening the bag is rather bland with no hint of bergamont.  Believe it or not, the aroma and flavor after steeping are a mild licorice.  I'm serious!  If I was given this tea with no forewarning, I would have assumed it was Licorice Tea.  The flavor is not unpleasant.  It is quite different.  It is definitely not Earl Grey.  Be forewarned if you are seeking an Earl Grey aroma/flavor - this is not it.

review/text: Notice that this taco seasoning packet weighs as much as the other brands, but doesn't have fillers like corn in it.  That means you get a lot more spices and flavor.  It's our favorite brand, and we've tried everything from store brands to organic/natural versions (a close second is La Preferida, and everything else is a distant third).  It's also great for people like me with multiple food allergies, or just if you're trying to cut chemicals out of your diet.  It's purpose is flavor and not excessive heat, so if you want to burn off your taste buds you'll have to add something to do that.

review/text: I have used agave for many things and find that it is a better alternative to sugar.  It will not give you the sugar plunge you get from sugary products.  If you are using this product in beverages please realize that it is not going to give you that same sugary, syrupy flavor that some people are used to from regular sugar or substitutes.  It is a subtle sweetness.<br /><br />I have served this product to friends, and those who are used to a sugary taste in their tea didn't care for it as much as those friends who don't use a lot of sugar.  It really depends on what you are used to.  I have no complaints about this product.<br /><br />Agave is also better for people who have diabetes, as it does not spike blood sugar levels.<br /><br />Don't pass up on trying this great alternative to sugar.  It is worth letting your tastebuds adapt to the subtleness.  It is also great for baking.  Also, this is now labeled as organic, so another reason to try it.

review/summary: convenient way of taking your agave with you!
review/text: I was hesitant about this product based on some customer reviews that said there were difficulties opening the little sticks and that they (the customers, not the sticks) got agave all over their fingers... I wonder if Stash read the reviews and changed their packaging?  I have not had this problem, and I'm usually *awful* at opening packaging! With these, I simply bite off the end (gross, I know, but I am a student and I don't/can't carry a knife around with me in my bookbag all day) and squeeze it into my coffee.  It's a great way to have my agave with me because most coffee shops and cafes have not yet started stocking this alongside their poisonous sugar alternatives (you know, those pink, blue, and yellow packets).  Keeps my blood sugar from spiking, sweetens my coffee--what more could you ask for?

review/summary: Smell delightful, taste not so much
review/text: I picked up these honey sticks because I'm in a chai tea phase and thought they'd be nice to add to a simple black tea. Upon taking one from the box, I was treated to a wonderful scent of cinnamon and spices that reminded me of Christmas time.  I brewed my tea, added the stick of honey and stirred.  As I took that first sip, I couldn't much smell the honey I just added.  As the tea coated my tongue I was waiting and waiting for the scent of the honey stick to hit my tongue and it never really did. I could taste a tiny bit of honey, but nothing more than if I added plain clover honey to my tea.  It was rather underwhelming.  My second cup I tried 2 sticks and it was a little better, but for the price, I'd much rather just buy chai tea bags.<br /><br />All in all, don't expect it to taste the way it smells.  Far too weak in just a simple black tea, but smells divine still sealed up!

review/summary: Sweet Treat!
review/text: These Chai Honey Sticks are SO good!  I enjoy eating one or two when I have a craving for something sweet.  It also makes a fun non-sugar sweet treat for my toddler.  The straws are the perfect size to add to a 6oz cup of tea too.

review/summary: Portable Health
review/text: I agree with other reviewers about Agave in general and also specifically this product.  Know that I have a pretty big sweet tooth, and thanks to Agave I feel I'm slowly taming it.  I do find Agave to be sufficiently satisfying -- with the right amount.  And it makes me feel very good to know I'm not jacking up my blood sugar level with sugar, and that I'm not putting sugar (which I increasingly think of as poison) into my body.  But you do have to use around the same amount as regular sugar, maybe sometimes less, sometimes more.  Various mfgs. of the product claim you can use less.  I have not found this to be the case.<br /><br />Regarding the sticks specifically, you do have to squeeze fairly hard and repeatedly to get it all out, and inevitably some gets on your fingers.  However, given the above pluses, in the absence of anything better I'm willing to settle for the drawbacks as opposed to putting sugar or -- quel horreur -- artificial sweetners into my body when I'm away from home.

review/summary: Agave Nectar
review/text: It's great to have agave in a portable format.  But is is difficult to open.  The directions say to pinch to open.  They are not so easy to pinch.  I have found if you bend the tube about 1 inch above the end then pinch the end it helps.  But the agave often gets on your fingers.

review/summary: alternative sweetner
review/text: I was disappointed in this product, as I had read and heard that this was an excellent sweetner, and it only took a small amount.  NOT TRUE!  I had a 8 ounce glass of tea, and added two "straws" of Nectar, and you couldn't even tell anything had been added.  Expensive if  you had to use a whole pack to slightly sweeten anything.

review/summary: Deceptive Term = "Sticks"
review/text: When I ordered these, based on the description, I thought the honey was somehow hardened into stick-form and thus would 'melt' into a cup of hot tea.  I was surprised when I discovered these sticks were actually thin plastic straws filled with honey!  There is no way I'm going to insert a plastic straw into a hot cup of tea. I'm not sure it would work anyway; I suppose you could cut open each end and then blow the honey in the tea.  Does Stash think you're going to sip on these straws?  I don't know what the company was thinking when they produced this product, other than as a candy to be eaten.<br /><br />I believe the term "stick" does not accurately describe this product and is misleading.  I doubt it's intentional, however.  The Stash Tea Company is an excellent company and has many high quality teas and products.<br /><br />The honey flavored with chai spices is good enough but frankly, it it a very expensive way to buy honey.  Better to buy a jar and flavor it yourself.  I wound up using these Chai Honey Sticks by cutting open one end and pressing out the honey into a tea cup/pot, which was messy and time consuming.<br /><br />I love Stash tea... drink it every morning.  But this product is a bust and I would never purchase it again.

review/text: If you want to add a hint of Meyer lemon flavor to a dish, then just add a drizzle of this wonderful oil.  Vegetables, fish, etc.  I've tried several brands and find this to have the nicest flavor of lemon with the buttery smooth flavor of Mission olives.  Not an every day cooking oil, but a finishing touch on many dishes.

review/summary: Premium Edge Dry Cat Food for Kitten
review/text: My 6 month old male Tuxedo cat likes Premium Edge Dry Cat Food for Kitten, Chicken, Salmon and Vegetables, which is "Y" shaped kibble, similar to Californian Natural <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F782JY">Chicken and Rice Dry Cat and Kitten Food - 5 lb - Bag</a>. Premium Edge has a higher fat content than California Natural, and is therefore recommended only for kittens. Based on the stated ingredients and nutritional information, I award Premium Edge Dry Cat Food for Kitten, Chicken, Salmon and Vegetables, "5 Stars," even though the bag does not feature a resealable strip, which is a nice feature that some other kibble cat food bags have.

review/text: I was very pleased with the ingredient quality, taste (according to the kitties), price, and reasonable kibble size of this food. I fed this food to approximately 20 different cats and it was well received by the majority, even the extremely picky one. My cats eat a variety of food. They eat homemade raw, freeze dried raw, grain free dry/canned, and non grain-free dry/canned food. My personal, senior picky cat easily vomits with most food...this food was very easy on her sensitive stomach. I would not hesitate to purchase this food again

review/summary: Happy Camper
review/text: I bought this to try on two registered Maine Coon kittens, as one is picky and refused all previous dry foods.  I feed wet food several times a day and keep dry food available at all times.  To my surprise, they both love this dry food.  For a lower priced dry food, it has exceptional ingredients.  Fat content is high, but that's good for active, growing kittens.  I love hearing them crunching between wet food feedings.  At 12 months, I'll try to find a different dry food they like, but for now I'm a very happy camper.

review/summary: Two Siberians like it!
review/text: When we brought home two 3-month-old purebred Siberian kittens, this was the dry food I picked for them.  Wolfram, the boy, prefers this to his wet canned food!  Catmium, the girl, likes wet food better, but she'll eat this when she's hungry and there's no wet food.  (They also eat the kitten versions of Fancy Feast wet canned food; it used to be 1 can per cat daily, but we've cut down to half a can per cat daily.  Catmium was gobbling her wet food and then eating Wolfram's, and Wolfram was letting her, preferring to eat dry food; he likes the crunchiness.  Catmium didn't need two cans a day, so now we just put out one can a day and they eat dry food if they don't get enough of the wet.)  They are growing quickly, and they are adorable little furballs full of energy.  Their coats are soft and luxurious, too.

review/text: I just bought this soup today at my local grocer, brought it back to work with me, heated it up and almost spit out my first bite.  The taste is so sweet, and it's not just the aftertaste as a previous commenter said.  This soup is horrible!  It tastes nothing like true Cajun red beans and rice.  I tried complaining via the Healthy Choice website today, only to have their servers fail twice before it wiped my complaint.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS SOUP.<br /><br />I have never been so dissatisfied with food before I ate this soup.  I'm the type that will say, "eh, it doesn't taste good, but I bought it, so I'll eat it," but miraculously I ate three spoonfuls before I gave up and tossed the rest in the trash.  Tomato puree is one of the first three ingredients (high sugar), followed closely by evaporated cane juice?  Who puts evaporated cane juice in red beans and rice?  Healthy Choice, that's who!  Hey, Healthy Choice, maybe if you didn't add the evaporated cane juice this soup may very well be worth eating, and would probably have a few calories less than it already does.<br /><br />P.S. I bought this soup today not because it was "healthy" or "low fat" but because it didn't have wheat in it.  SORRY GLUTEN FREE PEOPLE. THIS SOUP SUCKS.

I especially appreciate that their candy will never include artificial food coloring or flavors. I can trust that the candy is natural and the owner is so helpful. She will always tell me where the ingredients came from and exactly what is in them. She and her employees have been very easy to work with. My friends who have children with severe nut, gluten and milk allergies LOVE Indie. All their chocolate and candy is made in a big 8 free facility - no cross contamination!!

review/text: I love this tea.  I first discovered the pleasures of chai after attending a yoga class.  The yoga instructor made tea for us.  I wanted to make some on my own, and I tried many brands and recipes, including making it from scratch.  This is the best tea I found. In my opinion, steeping tea bags makes a weak, bland tea.  You really need to use loose tea and cook it according to the directions.  I use half and half for the milk, and it makes a rich, spicy tea.  Additionally, for the sweetener, I use maple syrup instead of honey or sugar.  It might sound odd, but the maple syrup blends with the chai spices much better.  If you want to make authentic chai (instead of using some kind of processed powdery mix), try this one.

review/summary: Best Value for Chinese 5 Spice
review/text: As a foodie, I use a lot of Chinese 5 Spice powder in my daily cooking.  It is impossible to get the amount of 5 spice for this price!  All my dishes taste great!

review/summary: Five Spice Powder
review/text: You can make this mix yourself, but the Star Anise is often difficult to find.  Usually I use this mix to make Oriental-style pork or chicken dishes, but today I added a little to some fish boiled with lemon juice and black pepper.  It was very good without being actually Oriental in overall impression.

review/summary: Mixed wrong
review/text: I had ordered some of these a few months back and they were great, but the latest batch was terrible. All anise is what it tasted like. They sent two more that we're just as bad.<br /><br />Maybe it will eventually get the right mix back in stock but I ordered elsewhere.

review/summary: If its all natural, this is like panacea of Spice mixes
review/text: Hoping there is no MSG in this, this tastes extremely good when i make it with toasted fish. I used to eat fried chicken and other chicken dishes when i was young and had no idea they tasted so good because of this spice mix. Now i know when i remember about the great aroma and lip smacking flavor this imparts to my fish.  This is also good in soups and gives you a kind of addiction that you will want to put this spice mix into everything you eat.<br />Would like to add this will make anyone eat any kind of meat or vegetable, in my case I prefer costly red salmon in a can but pink salmon is so cheaper and now with Five spice pink salmon toast feels as enjoyable as anything else i have eaten.

review/summary: Very large ground spice jars.
review/text: My only complaint is that there's so much of it, I don't use a huge amount of 5 spice, so I gave 1 jar to my sister. Good enough.

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: I'm disappointed with the flavor. The chocolate notes are especially weak. Milk thickens it but the flavor still disappoints. This was worth a try but I'll never buy again. I will use what's left, which will be gone in no time thanks to the small cans.

review/summary: Perfect for our maltipoo
review/text: These stars are small, so you can give 10-15 of those in one training session.  I tried to train our dog with "Ceaser dog treats",  it just made our puppy hyper.  If you compare the ingredients, you will know why.  Little stars has just basic food ingredients without any preservatives and food coloring.  Sweet potato flavor also did not make my hand smell like dog food.
